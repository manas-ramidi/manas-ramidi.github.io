        Assumptions impose boundaries for thinking<br>
        <b>The Why Technique:</b><br>
        - Asked when one does not know the answer, familiar terms are questioned. Nothing is sacred. Example: Why are blackboards black?<br>
        
        - The attitude is, "This is not going to work, but what does this lead to."<br>
        - Critical evaluation is temporarily suspended to develop a generative frame of mind in which flexibility and variety can be used with confidence.<br>
        
        - If one takes any situation and breaks it down into fractions, one can restructure the situation by putting the fractions together in a new way.<br>
        
        - Reverse the situation even though it is ridiculous.<br>
        
        <b>Brainstorming sessions:</b><br>
        > Should be short (30-45 minutes) and resisted from extending.<br>
        > There should be no criticism or evaluation.<br>
        > Even the most ridiculous ideas can be stated.<br>
        
        <b>Choice of Entry Point:</b><br>
        > Attention settles over the most obvious entry point, so deliberately try to rotate attention over all parts of the problem.<br>
        > To restructure a situation, one may need no more than a slight shift in attention. On the other hand, if there is no shift in attention, it may be very difficult to look at the situation in a different way.<br>
        
        <b>Random Simulation:</b><br>
        - With random simulations, one deliberately mixes an unconnected piece of information to disturb the original pattern. Search a dictionary for a random word, then try to relate it with the problem.<br>
        
        <b>Block by Openness:</b><br>
        - It is interesting that we have developed methods for dealing with things which are wrong but no methods for things which are right. We do not explore right further and come to a halt.<br>
        
        <b>Handling Cliche Units:</b><br>
        - Trimming and splitting<br>
        - Abstraction and extraction<br>
        - Combining<br>
        
        - If a function is decided, then design ideas are very fixed. So think:<br>
          · How abstraction of a function can lead to different ways of carrying out the function.<br>
          · How one may need to change a particular idea of function in order to generate new approaches.<br>
        
        <b>Design Setting:</b><br>
        1. Generate Alternatives<br>
        2. Look beyond for better<br>
        3. Remove cliche domination<br>
