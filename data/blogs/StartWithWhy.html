        - There are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold position of power, those who lead inspire us.<br><br>

        - In the Japanese auto plant, they didn't examine the problem and accumulate data to figure out the best solution—they engineered the outcome they wanted from the beginning.<br><br>
        - Great leaders understand value in things we cannot see.<br>
        - Moto with RAZER confused innovation with novelty. Real innovation changes the course of industries or societies.<br>
        - Novelty can just drive short-term sales.<br>
        - Apple decided they would tell service providers what the phone would do.<br><br>

        - Golden ratio offered a formula that could produce repeatable and predictable results in places where such results might have been assumed to be a random occurrence or coincidence.<br>
        - Though Creative Tech was first with HDD music player, Apple's '1000 songs in your pocket' >> 5GB MP3 player advert.<br>
        - If a customer feels inspired to buy a product rather than manipulated, they will be able to verbalize the reasons why they think the product they bought is better.<br>
        - Railroad companies were obsessed with what they do—railroads—rather than why—mass transportation, so were driven out by airlines.<br>
        - Neocortex controls rationale and language (What), Limbic brain controls feelings and decision-making (How, Why gut feelings).<br>
        - Great leaders are good at giving things we would never think of asking for. Ex: Apple gave GUI, buttonless phones.<br>
        - Feeling clean is more important to people than being clean; the entire detergent industry was focusing on whiteness for long.<br><br>

        - For values or guiding principles to be truly effective, they have to be verbs. It's not integrity; it's always do the right thing. It's not innovation; it's look at the problem from a different angle.<br>
        - WHY is just a belief; HOWs are the actions you take to realize that belief. WHATs are results of that action.<br>
        - Authenticity is when you say and do the things you actually believe.<br>
        - "We are the champion for the common man"—the WHY Southwest Airlines started.<br>
        - Cheap is just one of the things Southwest does that helps us understand what they believe.<br>
        - The ability to put a WHY into words provides the emotional context for decisions and offers great confidence than "I think it's right." <br>
        - You have to earn trust by communicating that you share the same values.<br><br>

        - Bethune talked everything in terms of how it benefited employees.<br>
        - Bethune told employees that each time Continental's on-time % rate tops, each employee received a check for $65. Though it cost the company 2.5 million a month, it avoided 5 million per month in late losses. Separate checks for this as a symbol of winning. Measured things employees could truly control and made stakes win or lose together.<br><br>

        - Great companies do not hire skilled people and motivate them; they hire already motivated people and inspire them.<br>
        - Samuel Pierpont Langley was smart, had cash, and the best people—but he saw airplanes as his ticket to be rich and famous fast.<br><br>
        - Wright brothers had not finished high school, only proceeds from a bicycle shop—they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it could change the world.<br>
        - Average companies give their people something to work on; in contrast, most innovative organizations give their people something to work towards.<br>
        - Great companies give their people purpose or a challenge around which to develop ideas rather than simply instructing them to make a better mousetrap.<br><br>

        - According to the law of diffusion, mass-market success can only be achieved after you penetrate 15-18% of the market.<br>
        - People followed Dr. King not because of his idea of changed America, but because of their idea of changed America.<br><br>

        - All the things charismatic leaders did were the tangible ways they found to bring their WHYs to life.<br>
        - Walt Disney (Why type) dreamed and drew, Roy (How type) stayed in the shadow and formed the empire—distribution, merchandise.<br>
        - Most successful entrepreneurs are How type.<br>
        - Why-How special partnership, best HOWs—those with the strength of ego to admit they are not visionaries themselves but are inspired by the leader's vision and know how to build the structure that can bring it to life.<br><br>

        - Apple does 'lifestyle marketing'—products integrated into style of lives.<br>
        - If WHAT doesn't prove WHY, you'll be forced to compete on price, service, quality, features, and benefits.<br><br>

        - Walmart confused WHY—to serve people, with HOW—to offer low prices.<br>
        - Starbucks' vision: building a comfortable environment between work and home—"third space," used to offer ceramic cutlery.<br><br>

        Apple purpose: to give individuals the power to stand up to established power.<br>
        - Apple's WHY developed during the rebellious 60-70s.<br>
        - Gaining clarity of WHY is not hard. It is the discipline to trust one's gut, stay true to one's purpose, cause, or beliefs.<br><br>

        - When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.<br>
