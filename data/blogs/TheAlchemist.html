      <ul>
        <li>Four obstacles in realising dreams- sense of impossibility of things we want to do, Fear of losing love, fear of defeats, fear of realising the dreams for which we have been fighting all our lives.</li>
        <li>But if you believe yourself worthy of the thing you fought so hard to get, then you become an instrument of God, you help the Soul of the World, and you understand why you are here.</li>
        <li>World's greatest lie- at certain point in our lives we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.</li>
        <li>One great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of universe. It's your mission on earth.</li>
        <li>Three was a language in the world that everyone understood. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose and as a part of a search for something believed in and desired.</li>
        <li>Wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise.</li>
        <li>God created the world so that through its visible objects, men could understand his teachings and marvels of his wisdom.</li>
        <li>Most people see the world as a threatening place and, because they do, the word turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.</li>
        <li>The only thing that makes dreams impossible to achieve is fear of failure.</li>
        <li>Life is really generous to people who peruse their destiny.</li>
        <li>You say "when we die", but time is another of these things that we need to help ourselves to go through life, but it does not exist.</li>
        <li>Omens are the individual language that guides you towards your own destiny.</li>
