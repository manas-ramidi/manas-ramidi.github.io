            Habits are compound interest of self improvement.<br>
            <br>
            For better results, forget about setting goals, focus on system.<br>
            <br>
            Problems with goals<br>
            1. Winners and loosers have same goals<br>
            2. Achieving goals is only a momentary change<br>
            3. Goals restrict happiness<br>
            4. Goals are at odds with long term progress<br>
            <br>
            - 3 layers of behavior change - outcomes, processes, identities.<br> 
            - The more pride you have in particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.<br>
            -whatever is your identity right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing an evidence of new identity. <br>
            -Ask, "who is the type of person that could get those results?"<br>
            - process for identity change<br>
               1.Decide the type of person you want to be.<br>   2.Prove it to your self with small wins<br>
            <br>
            -Feedback loop behind human behaviour - try, fail, learn, try differently.<br>
            -Habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, reward. <br>
            - 4 laws of behavior change<br>
               1. Make it obvious<br>
               2. Make it attractive<br>
               3. Make it easy<br>
               4. Make it satisfying<br>
            <br>
            - Pointing and calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to more a conscious level by better actions.<br>
            - Habits Scorecard technique.<br>
            - People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. <br>
            - Implementation intention: I will {behaviour} at {time} in {location}.<br>
            - Habit stacking: After {current habit}, I will {new habit}.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. <br>
            - Avoid mixing of contexts of one habit with another ex- Chair for reading, focus on desk.<br>
            - Stop thinking of environment as filled objects, start thinking as filled with relationships. <br>
            <br>
            - To eliminate bad habit, reduce exposure to cue that causes it. <br>
            <br>
            -Dopamine is released also when you anticipate pleasure. <br><br>
            We need to make habits attractive as expectation of reward motivates us to act in first place. <br>
            -Temptation Building: Strategy to pair action you want to do with an action you need to do
            Habit Stacking + Temptation Building: <br>
               1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].<br>
               2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].<br>
            <br>
            We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close,  the many, the powerful. <br>
            <br>
            -Reframing habits to highlight their benefits rather than drawbacks is a fast way to reprogram mind and habits.<br> 
            - cause of habit is prediction that proceeds them. The prediction leads to feeling.<br>
            - create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy before a difficult habit. <br>
            
            - Best is the enemy of the good.<br>
            - Focus on taking action not motion.<br>
            - Amount of time performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed. <br>
            - Business is a never ending quest to deliver same result.<br>
            - addition by subtraction- Japanese lean production.<br>
            - remove points of friction with habits. <br>
            <br>
            -Two-Minute Rule- when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do it.<br>
            - if this feels forced, then stop exactly at 2 min.<br>
            -the more you ritualise at beginning of habit, the more you can slip into focus.<br>
            <br>
            - Commitment device is a choice you make in present that locks in better behaviour in the future. <br>
            - Use Tech to automate decisions.<br>
            - Technology creates a level of confidence that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. <br>
            <br>
            -The more immediate pleasure you get from an action,  the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long term goals.<br>
            -Cardinal Rule of behaviour change - what is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided. <br>
            -Make avoidance(frivolous spending)visible and reward(like add money to buy jacket a/c) for its substitute.<br>
            -To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful- even if its a small way.<br>
            <br>
            - Marking progress is satisfying especially with visual measures like moving marbles, pins, Habit tracker.<br>
            - Never miss twice.<br>
            
            -An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction.<br> 
            -A habit contract can be used to add social cost to any behavior. <br>
            
            - The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the area where habits are more likely to be satisfying.<br>
            - Google famously asks its people to spend 80% of workweek on official job and 20% on projects of choice.<br>
            -Finding favoured habits:<br>
               1. What feels fun to me but work to others?<br>
               2. What makes me lose track of time?<br>
               3. Where do I get greater returns than the average person?<br>
               4. What comes naturally to me?<br><br>
            - Play the game that favours your strengths. If you can't find a game that favours you create one by specialisation. <br>
            
            - The Goldilocks Rule states we experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on their edge of current abilities. <br>
            - slight dip in motivation, leads to seeking novelty and derailing. <br>
            - variable rewards amplify craving.<br>
            - Pros stick to schedule, amateurs let life get in way.<br>
            
            - Whenever you're looking to improve, rotate through 4 laws of change until you find next bottleneck. <br>
            
            - "Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming". And suffering is between craving a change in state and getting it. <br>
            -"He who has a why to live for can almost bear any how" == Great craving can power great action. <br>
            - Satisfaction = Liking - Wanting.<br>
