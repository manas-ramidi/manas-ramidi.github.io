        Habits are compound interest of self improvement.<br><br>
        For better results, forget about setting goals, focus on system.<br><br>
        Problems with goals:<br>
        1. Winners and losers have the same goals.<br>
        2. Achieving goals is only a momentary change.<br>
        3. Goals restrict happiness.<br>
        4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress.<br><br>
        - 3 layers of behavior change - outcomes, processes, identities.<br>
        - The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.<br>
        - Whatever is your identity right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.<br>
        - Ask, "Who is the type of person that could get those results?"<br>
        - Process for identity change:<br>
          1. Decide the type of person you want to be.<br>
          2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.<br><br>
        - Feedback loop behind human behavior - try, fail, learn, try differently.<br>
        - Habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, reward.<br>
        - 4 laws of behavior change:<br>
          1. Make it obvious.<br>
          2. Make it attractive.<br>
          3. Make it easy.<br>
          4. Make it satisfying.<br><br>
        - Pointing and calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by better actions.<br>
        - Habits Scorecard technique.<br>
        - People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.<br>
        - Implementation intention: I will {behavior} at {time} in {location}.<br>
        - Habit stacking: After {current habit}, I will {new habit}.<br><br>
        If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.<br>
        - Avoid mixing contexts of one habit with another, e.g., Chair for reading, focus on desk.<br>
        - Stop thinking of the environment as filled with objects; start thinking of it as filled with relationships.<br><br>
        - To eliminate a bad habit, reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.<br><br>
        - Dopamine is released when you anticipate pleasure.<br><br>
        We need to make habits attractive as the expectation of reward motivates us to act in the first place.<br>
        - Temptation Building: Strategy to pair action you want to do with an action you need to do.<br>
        Habit Stacking + Temptation Building:<br>
          1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].<br>
          2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].<br><br>
        We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close, the many, the powerful.<br><br>
        - Reframing habits to highlight their benefits rather than drawbacks is a fast way to reprogram the mind and habits.<br>
        - The cause of a habit is the prediction that precedes it. The prediction leads to feeling.<br>
        - Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy before a difficult habit.<br><br>
        - Best is the enemy of the good.<br>
        - Focus on taking action, not motion.<br>
        - The amount of time performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.<br>
        - Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result.<br>
        - Addition by subtraction - Japanese lean production.<br>
        - Remove points of friction with habits.<br><br>
        - Two-Minute Rule: When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do it.<br>
        - If this feels forced, then stop exactly at 2 minutes.<br>
        - The more you ritualize the beginning of a habit, the more you can slip into focus.<br><br>
        - Commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.<br>
        - Use tech to automate decisions.<br>
        - Technology creates a level of confidence that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires.<br><br>
        - The more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.<br>
        - Cardinal Rule of behavior change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated; what is immediately punished is avoided.<br>
        - Make avoidance (e.g., frivolous spending) visible and reward its substitute (e.g., save for a jacket).<br>
        - To get a habit to stick, you need to feel immediately successful, even if in a small way.<br><br>
        - Marking progress is satisfying, especially with visual measures like moving marbles, pins, or a habit tracker.<br>
        - Never miss twice.<br><br>
        - An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction.<br>
        - A habit contract can be used to add social cost to any behavior.<br><br>
        - The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are where habits are more likely to be satisfying.<br>
        - Google famously asks its people to spend 80% of their workweek on official jobs and 20% on projects of choice.<br>
        - Finding favored habits:<br>
          1. What feels fun to me but work to others?<br>
          2. What makes me lose track of time?<br>
          3. Where do I get greater returns than the average person?<br>
          4. What comes naturally to me?<br><br>
        - Play the game that favors your strengths. If you can't find a game that favors you, create one by specialization.<br><br>
        - The Goldilocks Rule states we experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of current abilities.<br>
        - A slight dip in motivation leads to seeking novelty and derailing.<br>
        - Variable rewards amplify craving.<br>
        - Pros stick to a schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.<br><br>
        - Whenever you're looking to improve, rotate through 4 laws of change until you find the next bottleneck.<br><br>
        - "Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming." Suffering is between craving a change in state and getting it.<br>
        - "He who has a why to live for can almost bear any how" == Great craving can power great action.<br>
        - Satisfaction = Liking - Wanting.<br>
