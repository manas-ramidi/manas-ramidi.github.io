        • The single most powerful pattern noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.<br><br>
        • "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"<br>
        Answer like, most people believe in X, but in truth it's opposite of X.<br>
        PT: "Most people think the future will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more."<br><br>
        • Opposite yet right principles after dot-com crash:<br>
          1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.<br>
          2. A bad plan is better than no plan.<br>
          3. Competitive markets destroy profits.<br>
          4. Sales matter just as much as the product.<br><br>
        • Creating value is not enough; you also have to capture it, e.g., Airlines industry vs Google.<br><br>
        • Ask yourself: How much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes?<br>
        • It's really competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive.<br>
        • If you're less sensitive to social cues, you're less likely to do the same thing as people around you.<br>
        • Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.<br>
        • Competition is better a destructive force than a sign of value.<br>
        • The value of a business today is the sum of money it will make in the future.<br><br>
        • Characteristics of Monopoly:<br>
          1. Proprietary technology<br>
            - Be at least 10 times better than substitutes.<br>
            - Ex. PayPal made buy/sell on eBay 10 times better; Amazon, 10 times more books.<br>
          2. Network effects<br>
            - To reap this, first users of a small network should find the product valuable.<br>
          3. Economies of scale<br>
            - A good startup should have potential for great scale built into its first design.<br>
          4. Branding<br><br>
        • Building a Monopoly:<br>
          1. Start small and monopolize.<br>
            - Start with very small markets.<br>
          2. Scaling up.<br>
          3. Don't disrupt.<br>
            - Attracts bad attention, e.g., Napster.<br>
            - Do not directly challenge.<br>
          4. The last will be first.<br>
            - Make the last great development.<br><br>
        • Optimists embrace the future; pessimists fear it.<br>
        • Progress without planning is what we call evolution.<br>
        • Jobs designed his business with multi-year plans; forget MVP.<br>
        • A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.<br><br>
        • The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.<br>
        Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works.<br><br>
        • Two types of Secrets:<br>
          - What secrets is nature not telling?<br>
          - What secrets are people not telling?<br><br>
        • Thiel Law: A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.<br>
        • Distinguish Ownership, Possession, Control.<br>
        • Most conflicts erupt between ownership and control.<br>
        • In no case should a CEO of an early-stage venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 PA salary.<br>
        • Equity may not create perfect incentives, but it's the best way for a founder to keep everyone aligned.<br>
